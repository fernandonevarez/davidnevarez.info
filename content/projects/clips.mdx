While I've primarily favored React for web applications, I'm proficient in other technologies as well. To demonstrate my versatility, I embarked on building a video sharing platform using Angular.

Named "Clips," the platform is constructed using Angular and Firebase. Users can upload, watch, like, and comment on videos. Additionally, the application features a robust user authentication system facilitating sign up, log in, and log out functionalities.
