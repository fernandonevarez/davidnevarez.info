Although when it comes to web applications, I have always been a React guy, I more then able to use other teachnologies for the need of a project. So, to show that I'm able to create a indutry standard web application using Angular, I decided to build a video sharing platform.

The application is called clips and it is built using Angular and Firebase. The application allows users to upload, watch, like, and comment on videos. The application also has a user authentication system that allows users to sign up, log in, and log out.
