CodeDevils is an organization at Arizona State University dedicated to fostering a community of software development enthusiasts. Through workshops, hackathons, and various events, they aim to support students in learning and advancing as developers, with the ultimate goal of securing jobs or internships in the tech industry.

My involvement in the website revamp for CodeDevils was multifaceted, serving as both project manager and lead developer. Leading the development effort, I oversaw a complete redesign and reimplementation of the website using the Next.js framework. Additionally, I was responsible for establishing a system enabling members with no prior web development experience to contribute to the project by providing resources and documentation on how to contribute effectively.

Throughout my tenure on the website project, I experienced significant personal growth as a web developer and honed my leadership skills, ensuring team success regardless of its composition.
