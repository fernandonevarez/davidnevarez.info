CodeDevils is a organization at Arizona State University that focuses on creating a community of software development enthusiasts. They host workshops, hackathons, and other events to help students learn and grow as developers and get involved in the tech community. So that hopefully they can get a job or internship in the tech industry.

My involvement with CodeDevils' website revamp has been through my time as a project manager and lead developer. I was tasked with leading the development of the revamped website, which included a complete redesign and reimplementation of the website using the Next.js framework. However, along with the redesign, I was also tasked with setting up a system to allow for members with no prior web development experience to contribute to the team through providing resources and documentation on how to contribute to the website.

Throughtout my time working on the website, I grow a lot as a web developer and learned how to lead teams to be successful no matter who is in it.
