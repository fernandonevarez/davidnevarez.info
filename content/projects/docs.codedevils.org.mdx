This project was for CodeDevils and it's members, for a couple of reasons, first was for the personal reason of wanting future developers of my projects to be able to easily understand how to use and add to them. As one of the biggest issues I had when i joined the CodeDevils' dev team was the lack of documentation for the projects I was working on. The second reason was to help the CodeDevils' dev team to have a central place to find documentation for all of the projects they work on.



With the development of this project, I was also able to teach members of CodeDevils about the importance of documentation and how to write it.
