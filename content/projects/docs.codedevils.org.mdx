This project was undertaken for the benefit of CodeDevils and its members, driven by a couple of key motives. Firstly, I aimed to address the personal frustration of encountering inadequate documentation when joining the CodeDevils' development team. I wanted future developers of my projects to have clear and accessible guidelines for understanding and contributing to them. Secondly, I sought to provide the CodeDevils' development team with a centralized repository of documentation for all their projects.

During the development of this project, I seized the opportunity to educate CodeDevils' members on the significance of documentation and how to effectively write it, thereby fostering a culture of comprehensive project documentation within the organization.
