Project Humanities at Arizona State University is an organization dedicated to advancing the humanities and social sciences through research, education, and public engagement. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and dialogue, Project Humanities aims to address critical social issues and promote social justice and equity in the community.

During my involvement with the Project Humanities website, I played a pivotal role in enhancing the website's user experience and accessibility. I collaborated with the organization's dirctor and staff to identify key areas for improvement and implemented new features and content to engage visitors and promote the organization's mission.
