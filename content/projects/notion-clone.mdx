In this project, I built a Notion clone using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete pages. It also supports drag-and-drop functionality for reordering pages.

I created this project to practice building a full-stack application with Next.js and TypeScript. I also wanted to explore the drag-and-drop functionality, along with the trash can & soft delete feature.


## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete pages
- Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering pages
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design
