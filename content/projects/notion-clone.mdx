In this project, I developed a Notion clone using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application enables users to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete) on pages, and it includes drag-and-drop functionality for reordering pages.

I undertook this project to enhance my proficiency in building full-stack applications with Next.js and TypeScript. Additionally, I aimed to explore drag-and-drop functionality and implement features like the trash can and soft delete.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete pages
- Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering pages
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design
