This website was constructed using Drupal 8, a content management system facilitating seamless content updates and management. Featuring a responsive design, the website ensures accessibility across diverse devices, spanning from desktop computers to smartphones.

During my tenure at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, I assumed responsibility for overseeing website content, guaranteeing its timeliness and accuracy. Additionally, I collaborated closely with the marketing team to devise and implement new content and features aimed at enhancing the overall user experience.
