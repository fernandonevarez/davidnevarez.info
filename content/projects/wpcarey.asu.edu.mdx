This website was built with Drupal 8, a content management system that allows for easy content updates and management. The website features a responsive design, making it accessible on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones.

While working for the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, I was responsible for managing the website content, ensuring that information was up-to-date and accurate. I also worked closely with the marketing team to develop new content and features to enhance the user experience.
