This Website, although not the most visually appealing looking back at it, was a great learning experience and was my first freelance project. I was hired by a local delivery service company in Phoenix, Arizona to create a website for them. The website was built using the Next.js framework and deployed on Vercel. The website was built with a mobile-first approach and is fully "responsive"(looking back, it wasn't fully responsive)

But although it's not my best work, it highlights my ability to learn and adapt to new technologies and frameworks quickly. It also shows my ability to work with clients and deliver a product that meets their needs.
