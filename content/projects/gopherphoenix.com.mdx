This website, while not the most visually appealing in retrospect, marked a significant learning milestone as my inaugural freelance project. I was commissioned by a local delivery service company in Phoenix, Arizona, to develop a website for them. Utilizing the Next.js framework, I deployed the website on Vercel, emphasizing a mobile-first approach in its design (albeit with some hindsight acknowledgment of its responsiveness shortcomings).

Despite its imperfections, this project underscores my capacity to rapidly learn and adapt to new technologies and frameworks. Furthermore, it showcases my ability to collaborate with clients and deliver a product tailored to their requirements.
