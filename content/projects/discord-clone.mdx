![Discord Clone](/projects/discord-clone.png)

With this project, I wanted to build a Discord clone using Next.js 13, React, Socket.io, Prisma, Tailwind, and MySQL and learn how to use Socket.io to build a real-time chat application.

This projects showcases my ability to build a full-stack application on short notice and my ability to learn new technologies quickly as I had never used Socket.io before building this project.
