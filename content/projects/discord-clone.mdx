![Discord Clone](/projects/discord-clone.png)

For this project, my aim was to construct a Discord clone utilizing Next.js 13, React, Socket.io, Prisma, Tailwind, and MySQL. My primary goal was to grasp the usage of Socket.io in developing a real-time chat application.

This endeavor demonstrates my proficiency in swiftly developing a full-stack application and my adeptness at rapidly acquiring new technologies, as I had no prior experience with Socket.io before undertaking this project.
