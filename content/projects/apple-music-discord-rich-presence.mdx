As an Apple Music user, it was disappointing not being able to display what I'm listening to on Discord. So, I developed a Discord rich presence for Apple Music.

Utilizing the Apple Music API and being part of Apple's developer program, I successfully crafted a Discord rich presence showcasing the current song, artist, and album art from Apple Music.
