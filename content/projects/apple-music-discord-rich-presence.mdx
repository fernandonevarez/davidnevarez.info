As a Apple Music user, missing out on the ability to show what I'm listening to on Discord was a bummer. So I decided to create a Discord rich presence for Apple Music.

Using the Apple Music API and being apart of Apple's developer program, I was able to create a Discord rich presence that shows the song, artist, and album art of the song you're currently listening to on Apple Music.
